  Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

 Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10+
-   Git

 Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.git)
    cd YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME
    ```

2.  Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    # Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  Create a `requirements.txt` file:**
    First, install all the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Mail qrcode Pillow WeasyPrint
    ```
    Then, create the requirements file:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    *(In the future, anyone can just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install everything.)*

4.  Set up Email Credentials (for Ticket Confirmation):
    -   This project uses Gmail to send emails. You need a Google App Password.
    -   Go to your Google Account -> Security -> 2-Step Verification (turn it on).
    -   Then go to App passwords, generate a new 16-digit password, and copy it.
    -   In your `app.py` file, find the `Mail Configuration` section and replace the placeholder values:
        ```python
        app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = 'your-email@gmail.com'
        app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = 'your-16-digit-app-password'
        ```
